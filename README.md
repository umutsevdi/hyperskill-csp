# JetBrains Academy Hyperskill - Code Sharing Platform Project

## About
There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers.
Using open web resources such as Pastebin is not always an option. In this project, you will create your own secure version of a code-sharing platform.
