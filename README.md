## About

There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers.

## Learning Outcomes

You will get acquainted with server development on Spring Boot and touch on some basic topics in Web-programming such as HTML, CSS, and JS.
This project is a part of the following track
